 * Callback interface for asynchronous responses.
 * There are two ways how the receiver of a response may pass it to a copper engine.
 * First, the receiver knows the engine and uses <code>engine.notify</code>.
 * Second, the receiver puts the response into a callback object, created and passed to it by the caller.
 * Callback objects are created using the <code>Workflow.createCallback()</code>.
